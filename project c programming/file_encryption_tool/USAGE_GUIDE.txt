File Encryption Tool Usage Guide

1. Compile the program:
   gcc -o encryptor encryptor.c

2. Run the program with the following syntax:
   ./encryptor <encrypt|decrypt> <input_file> <output_file> <key>

   - encrypt or decrypt: Choose the mode.
   - input_file: Path to the file to encrypt or decrypt.
   - output_file: Path where the output will be saved.
   - key: The encryption/decryption key (a string).

Example:
   To encrypt a file:
   ./encryptor encrypt secret.txt secret.enc mypassword

   To decrypt a file:
   ./encryptor decrypt secret.enc secret_decrypted.txt mypassword

Notes:
- The tool uses a simple XOR cipher and is not suitable for strong security needs.
- Use a strong and secret key to protect your data.
